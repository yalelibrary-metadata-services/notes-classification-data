    <title>One hundred new fables : embellished with designs to each fable / by James Northcote, R.A.</title>
    <note note_num="1">Manuscript. Consists of hand-written text as well as illustrations for Northcote's first series of fables, published in 1828 as: One hundred fables, original and selected.</note>
    <note note_num="2">Text is embellished with 175 illustrations prepared by Northcote in collage form; each composed of portions of various 18th-century engravings, many with additions in pen and ink and wash (see Muir, DNB and the preface to the 1838 edition of the fables for an account of this). According to the 4 p. index at end, there are about 175 fables, of which only 100 were eventually published. Some bear the pencilled word "omit."</note>
    <note note_num="3">The artist William Harvey copied Northcote's designs from the ms. onto wood blocks, which were then given to the wood engravers to cut (notably John Jackson, responsible for about half the blocks).</note>
    <note note_num="4">In two boxes. Ms. is disbound and placed in box. Original red velvet-covered casing is stored in a separate box.</note>

The incipit of al-Ghayṭī's shorter commentary in Berlin catalog 6681 is the same, but the explicit is somewhat different; on the other hand, the longer commentary, Berlin catalog 6680, has the same incipit, but is incomplete at end. Muḥammad al-Faraḍī's commentary (Berlin catalog 6688, Hitti 437) seems to have the same incipit, but the explicit is different. The same incipit appears in Gotha 295-297, which are listed by Brockelmann (S II, p. 333) under both al-Ghayṭī and al-Faraḍī.</note>
