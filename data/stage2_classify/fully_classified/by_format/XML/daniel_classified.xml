The Polygot was printed and published for the proprietors at the 'Punch' Office, Melbourne, October 1858. The wrapper has an etching of 'View on the Yarra near Dight's Mills' by F. Grusse on the front. The newsletter is an early example of a publication produced in several different languages; an indication of the 'multi-cultural' nature of the population of Victoria in the 1850s.</note>

    <note type="?" note_num="3">The Sarah Dixon was built at the Dixon shipyard on the Tantramar River in Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada, and launched on 18 September 1856. It made only two voyages to Australia. The first left Liverpool on 13 June 1857 under W. Salt as Master and arrived at Port Phillip Bay on 12 September 1857, returning to Britain via Guam. The second voyage, on which Walter Dutton travelled, departed Liverpool on 29 August 1858, again under W. Salt, and arrived at Port Melbourne on 6 December 1858. It was carrying 9 first-class and 190 intermediate &amp; steerage class passengers and a cargo of machinery. The Sarah Dixon departed Melbourne on 17 January 1859 bound for Bassein under ballast. In March 1859, the ship struck Baroguy Shoal in the Gulf of Marinban, near Rangoon, Burma and was a total loss.</note>
