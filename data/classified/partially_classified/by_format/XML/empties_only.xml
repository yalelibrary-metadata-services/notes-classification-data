The last drawing is particularly intricate: the top flap shows the man's skin; the three following flaps show muscles; the next shows the skull with an additional flap for the eye; then a flap for the brain matter; final few flaps show a variety of muscles and the larynx.

I finished authoring this book, titled 'al-Ḥiṣn al-ḥaṣīn min kalām Sayyid al-Mursalīn', on the afternoon of Sunday, 22 Dhū al-Ḥijjah, 791 [of the Hijrah = 20 December, 1389], at my school which I built at the top of ʻAqabat al-Kattān [neighborhood], inside protected Damascus (May the Almighty God protect it from calamities, and all the lands of the Muslims), during the time when all the gates of Damascus were closed, rather, blocked by boulders, while all the people were calling [upon God] for help, above the walls, whilst in great agony, because of the siege. The waters were cut off, the hands lifted up in supplication to God Almighty. The city was burnt, and most of it plundered. While everyone was afraid for himself, his family and his possessions, scared of his sins and evil acts, having fortified himself with whatever he could, I made this Ḥiṣn ["Fortress", i.e., the book which he authored] my fortress, entrusting myself to God, who suffices me and is my best advocate. I have authorized my children: Abū al-Fatḥ Muḥammad, Abū Bakr Aḥmad, Abū al-Qāsim ʻAlī, Abū al-Khayr Muḥammad, Fāṭimah, ʻĀʼishah, Salmá, and Khadījah, to transmit this book on my behalf, in addition to all what I myself am authorized to transmit. I have also authorized my contemporary scholars to do the same. Praise be to God alone in the beginning and at the end. May His prayers and peace be upon Muḥammad, the Lord of the created beings, and upon his family and his companions. May God forgive the author of this book, its copyist, its reader, he who beseeches God to forgive them, and all Muslims. Praise be to God, May God pray on our Master Muḥammad, the family of Muḥammad, the companions of Muḥammad, and Muslims. God suffices us, He is the best advocate.

This copy was completed on Saturday, the end of Shawwal, the year 1175 of the Hijrah of the Prophet [23 May, 1762], may prayer, peace, nobleness and honor be upon him."</note>
