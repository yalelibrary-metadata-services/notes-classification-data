3429277,Trattato di architectura civile e militare.,1,"""Aside from his additions to the ducal palaces at Urbino and Gubbio, it is [Francesco's] work as military architect for which he is renowned. The defenses that he designed for the duchy of Montefeltro are among the first attempts to build fortifications capable of withstanding cannon shot while being defended by flanking fire, in the manner that would ultimately lead to the fully realized angle bastions of the sixteenth century. Francesco deals substantially with fortification in the penultimate book of his Trattato. Like Vitruvius, he saw the art as an integral component of classical building tradition. Francesco's drawings show many forms of fortification, but few of these are fully effective or efficient. ... Francesco's writings were never published in his lifetime. The Trattato remained in manuscript form, surviving in several different versions, which date to essentially two different periods of his career. This copy was based on a later composition, completed sometime after 1482. While the drawings are at least partly in Francesco's hand, the text was written by copyists sometime around 1520.""--Compass and rule : architecture as mathematical practice in early modern England, 1550-1750.",o,will

Benedictus deus"" and on the back ""Exi cito in plateas & uico <...> uitatis et pauperes ac deb <,,,> es cecos et claudos compelle"". For the date, also given that it was still in Italy in quite modern times, can be safely assigned to northern or central Italy in the fifteenth century or very early sixteenth. Though the parchment is old, the binding itself is modern, i.e. early 20th century (just a bit of a falsification, probably done by Martini). The endpapers are on mechanical paper and the edges are not very scuffed. Autograph ""J. Martini"" of Giuseppe Martini on front paste-down.
