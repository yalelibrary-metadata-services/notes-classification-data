# Final Reorganization Report
**Generated:** 2025-11-14
**Status:** Complete


## Summary

- All main classified files verified: **0 empty types**
- Empty types subdirectory contains 2 files as expected; path attributes updated accordingly
- Total records preserved: 3,921 (2,127 in main files + 773 in empty_types)

- All `{person}_classified.xml` files have **NO empty types**
- A `{person}_classified.xml` file has no empty types if for all records in the file, each note has a type attribute, and this type attribute has a non-empty value.
- Records with empty types are in `empty_types/` subdirectory
- A `{person}_with_empty_types.xml` file holds all records from `{person}_raw` where for any given record within the file, there is at least one note with an empty attribute value AND at least one note with a non-empty attribute value
- If a record has all types empty, then is should be in any of the `classified` files.
